#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematical approach of applying engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. In the technology industry, Software Engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones in the evolution of software engineering include (1) Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C) (2) The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s (3) The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1)Requirements: This phase involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2)Design: This phase involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3)Implementation: This phase involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4)Testing: This phase involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5)Deployment: This phase involves releasing the software to users or customers.
6)Maintenance: This phase involves providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparation: Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall WHILE Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Contrasting both, they are aimed at achieving similar result at the end. Examples: Waterfall methodology can be used when developing a survey type of web solution from an analog survey data. On the other hand agile aproach can be used when all needed for providing the required solution can simply be obtained from an AI model when prompted rightly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): These are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: This is one of the challenges faced by software Engineers because requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
The importance of testings in software quality assurance is to help in identifying and fixing defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or instructions clearly, specifically and concisely to help get the best response from an AI model. The importance of promp engineering to AI model is simply to craft the prompt in the best possible clear and specific way for getting the desired result.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Cost of building a three bedroom bungalow in Nigeria.
Clear: Show me a current bill of quantity for the building of a three bedroom bungalow apartment in Lagos Nigeria.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is more detailed about the specific need.
